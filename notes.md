1. Ecological Forecasting is different from other forecasting because we cannot count species.
2. Forecast skill is not 'the ultimate test of theory', incredibly bad theory (of measurement & forecast) can have perfect forecast skill.

(Forecasts are only as good as the measurements...what *are* the measurements?) 

Why can't we just forecast the "raw" data: raw forecast accuracy is also meaningless (species x at distance y from observer z at site A and time T)

So everyone should pay attention to distance / abundance methods?

Can we 'break' distance methods - are they insentive to certain changes we may care about? Are they sensitive to details we don't care about but which may change?  

Can we postulate a distance method which will maximize our skill?

Will dumber distance methods lead to "better" forecasts (i.e. because they are less sensitive to changes, the abundance they predict looks more like historical abundances.  thus a stupid forecast, e.g. "last value" or "random walk" can appear to do rather well.  Also, for a given forecast method, scientific improvements in the abundance estimation could result in decreased forecast accuracy over time (i.e. because the forecast method was always poor, but this only becomes evident with improving quality of abundance estimation)
