Ecological Forecasting is different from other forecasting because we cannot count species.
Forecast skill is not 'the ultimate test of theory', incredibly bad theory (of measurement & forecast) can have perfect forecast skill.

(Forecasts are only as good as the measurements...what *are* the measurements?) 

Why can't we just forecast the "raw" data: raw forecast accuracy is also meaningless (species x at distance y from observer z at site A and time T)

Everyone should pay attention to distance / abundance methods?
