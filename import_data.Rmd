# remotes::install_github("cboettig/neonstore")
library(neonstore)

# Import NEON data

Browse all NEON data products:

```{r}
products <- neon_products()
products
```

Select several products to download to persistent local store. This need not
be re-run each time as data will be stored.  

```{r datasets}
## Register for a NEON_TOKEN to increase rate limit first, and set
## NEON_TOKEN as an environmental variable in your ~/.Rprofile.

## Doing too many of these at once will incur rate limiting! consider a subset.  
populations <- c(
    birds = "DP1.10003.001",
    beetles = "DP1.10022.001",
    ticks = "DP1.10093.001",
    mammals = "DP1.10072.001",
    zooplankton = "DP1.20219.001",
    macroinvert = "DP1.20120.001",
    mosquito = "DP1.10043.001"
